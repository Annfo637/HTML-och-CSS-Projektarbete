							<h4>Why on earth would anyone move to Mars?</h4>
							<p>
								The short answer is. Because we can. Why did Columbus travel
								west? Why did Marco Polo head east? Because it is that pull,
								that unknown, that prospect of adventure that compels humans to
								seek new frontiers to explore.
							</p>
							<p>
								Sending a manned mission to Mars is a fantastic adventure.
								Imagine living on another planet, millions of miles from the
								Earth; looking up into the sky with the knowledge that one of
								the 'stars' is actually the planet you were born on. Who can
								even envision the incredible feeling of being the first human in
								history to step out of the capsule and leave your footprint on
								the surface of Mars? By this we implore you to not just think of
								that feeling for the astronaut, but the experience for all those
								watching back home. Those who observed Neil Armstrong land on
								the Moon all those years ago still remember every detail â€“ where
								they were, who they were with and how they felt. The moment the
								first astronauts land on Mars will be our moment to remember.
							</p>
							<p>
								A second reason is good, old-fashioned curiosity. Where did Mars
								come from? Can it teach us about Earth's history? Is there life
								on Mars? These are just three of the hundreds of burning
								questions for scientists all over the world.

							<h4>Is this trip risky?</h4>
							<p>
								The trip to Mars cannot be called risk free. Like any venture in
								any means of travel, there are always things that could go
								wrong. In the case of Mars One, the following risks are
								conceivable:
							</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Accident(s) during launch</li>
								<li>Vital components could malfunction</li>
								<li>There could be problems when landing</li>
							</ul>
							<p>
								Although traveling to Mars will evidently bring risks, if you
								were to compare our mission to the first Moon mission in 1969,
								it quickly becomes apparent that this mission is much safer.

							<h4>What to do there?</h4>
							<p>
								During the working hours, the astronauts will be busy performing
								three main tasks: construction, maintenance and research.
								Besides work, they will also have time to relax.

							<h4>How long does it take to travel to Mars?</h4>
							<p>
								The trip takes around seven months; a bit longer than astronauts
								currently stay on the International Space Station.
							</p>
							<p>
								The precise duration of each journey depends on when it is
								taken. Because both Mars and Earth's orbits are not perfectly
								circular, the time it takes to travel between them varies from
								six to eight months.
							</p>
							<p>
								When determining the course to Mars, the maximum travel time for
								the astronauts is very important.
